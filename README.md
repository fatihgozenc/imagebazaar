# Imagebazaar

## A simple bash script to download all images in img tags from a web page.

I've created this script to save inspirations for my daily paintings. I am surfing on random websites everyday to gain some inspiration and saving images that I like. When I found a good collection I don't want to spend my time to download images one by one. I save more time for my creation process with this simple shell program.

## Dependencies and Compatibilty

It uses `curl`, `sed`, `grep` and some basic Linux commands to operate correctly. I haven't tested the usability on macOSX and Windows but it is working without any problems on CentOS8 and Debian at the moment.

## Usage

Just download the repo and run `./imagebazaar`. Then you can follow the instructions from the outputs.

### How it does affect works?

It saves me a lot of time while downloading collection of images and causes me to broaden my imagination faster. If you want to see the outcome of this imagination, you can follow my daily paintings here: [a link](https://instagram.com/fatihgozenc)

### Thanks for interest.

It may needs more development but it is working enough for me now. I hope it may be useful for someone too. Especially for inspiration hunters.


Cheers...
